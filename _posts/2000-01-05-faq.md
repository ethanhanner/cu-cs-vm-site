If you encounter issues using the VM not addressed below, please
contact
[help@cs.colorado.edu](mailto:help@cs.colorado.edu). Alternatively, you
may visit any of the [CU CS
LA](https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/la/) sessions or consult your
course staff.

## Questions

#### What is the username and password on the VM?

The default username:password combo is `user:user`. You may change
this password if you desire by running `passwd` from a terminal.

As on most Debian-based system, the root account is disabled. Use
`sudo` if you need to run privileged commands. 

#### How do I fix a VT-x/AMD-V error when trying to boot my VM?

If you receive an error message along the lines of:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine <VM Name>.

VT-x is disabled in the BIOS for both all CPU modes
(VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED).

Result Code:    E_FAIL (0x80004005)
Component:      ConsoleWrap
Interface:      IConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed}
{% endhighlight %}

Or any other error message mentioning **VT-x** or **AMD-V**, it
generally means VirtualBox is having trouble getting your processor to
support virtualization. This is normally due to one of the following
issues:

- Your machine supports VT-x/AMD-V, but it has been disabled in the
  BIOS
- Your machine does not support VT-x/AMD-V

To correct the former case, boot into your machine's BIOS and enable the
virtualization setting. The exact process for this differs by machine
(try Google or consult your machine's user manual), but the general
steps involve:

1. Shutdown your computer
2. Start your computer and select the appropriate key to enter the BIOS
setup menu (often F1, F2, F8, Del, Esc, or Enter)
3. Find the virtualization settings (often under security)
4. Change all virtualization-related features (e.g. VT-x, VT-d, AMD-V)
to enabled
5. Save your changes and reboot
6. Try launching the VM again

In the latter case (e.g. if you find no virtualization settings in
your BIOS), you may have to either upgrade your computer, install Linux
alongside your host operating system in dual boot mode, or use the machines
in CSEL (ECCS112).

#### Why is the network not working on the VM?

There are two common issues that prevent you from connecting to the internet
on the VM:

1. You are not connected to the Internet on the host opertaing system. The VM
takes the host's Internet connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) as an Ethernet connection.
If you are having difficulty connecting, troubleshoot this on your host and not
the VM.

2. If you are certain that you are connected to the Internet on the host but are
still unable to connect on the VM, then follow these steps: Shut down the CU CS VM.
Open up the VirtualBox window, and select the CU CS VM in the list on the left.
Click the Settings button near the top of the window (you should see a green
gear icon). In the window that pops up, navigate under Network and expand the
section labeled Advanced. Make sure the box next to "Cable Connected" is checked.
Then reboot the VM and see if you are automatically connected.

If you have made sure both of these things are done, and still cannot connect, then
bring your laptop by the office in CSEL (ECCS112B) and we will help you troubleshoot
the problem.
