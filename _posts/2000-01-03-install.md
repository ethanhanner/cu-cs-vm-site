## System Requirements

To run smoothly, the VM requires a minimum of:

- 4GB of RAM
- Intel Core i-series processor with
  [virtualization](http://ark.intel.com/Products/VirtualizationTechnology)
  support
- 2 physical processor cores
- 50GB of free HD space
- A modern 64-bit OS (Windows 7 or newer, OSX 10.7 or newer, or Linux 3.0 or newer)

## Install VMware

The first step to installing the VM is to install
[VMware](https://www.vmware.com). This is the
[hypervisor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) that we will use
to run the VM.

All students either majoring in CS or enrolled in a CS class should automatically
receive an email at the start of the semester with their account details for the vmware
webstore. The email will come from "University of Colorado - Department of Computer Science"
with the subject line "An account has been created for you". Follow the instructions in this
email to complete your registration. Once you are registered and logged in, you can access
the software downloads page.

If you are running a Windows or Linux operating system, click on the icon for VMware Workstation
12 and follow the instructions to add to cart, checkout, and download the software (you will
not be charged for this). You will receive a license key that you will need to copy into the program
once it is installed.

If you are running a Mac operating system, click on the icon for VMware Fusion 8 and follow the instructions
to add to cart checkout, and download the software. Make note of your license key as you will need to provide
it once you are running the program.

If you did not receive an email with a link to create your account on the WebStore, please contact
help@cs.colorado.edu, and provide your name and colorado.edu email address.

## Import VM Image

Once VMware has been installed, we need to import the CU CS VM
image. To complete this process:

1. Locate the VM image file: the `*.ovf` file in the [downloads](#obtain) above
2. Launch VMware (installed above)
3. From the VMware home tab, select `Open a Virtual Machine`
4. In the `Import` window that pops up, use the file picker to select
   the `*.ovf` VM image file from Step #1
5. Select `Next`
6. You will get an error message about the OVF file format giving you an option
   to retry. It will tell you that the VM may not work if you do this. Ignore it
   and just click retry. It will work.
7. Wait for the import process to complete: this may take 5 to 15
   minutes
9. When the import process has completed, you'll be taken to the VMware tab for
   your new VM. You can launch the VM from here by clicking the play button.
