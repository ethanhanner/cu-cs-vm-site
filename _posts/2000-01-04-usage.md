The VM runs a variant of [Ubuntu 16.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/)
[GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://www.kernel.org/linux.html)
called [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/). GNU/Linux is a
[Free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) operating system
popular amongst programmers and other advanced computer users. It is
also the OS behind many embedded systems (e.g. cars, thermostats,
etc), smart phones (e.g. Android), and most of the world wide web.

## Basics

To launch the VM, select it in the left-side VirtualBox VM list and
either double-click or select the green `Start` button at the top of
the VirtualBox window. The VM will launch in its own window. After
completing the boot process (you may see a black screen with scrolling
text for a few moments), the VM will present a the desktop. Once the
VM has booted you may:

- Resize the VM window: the desktop should resize itself to accommodate
  your desired window size
- Launch any of the installed VM programs (e.g. Geany, terminal, etc)
- Install new VM programs using the `apt` package manager
- Change VM settings
- Etc

From a UI perspective, the VM behaves a lot like other OSes you may be
familiar with such as OSX or Windows. The basics of how to complete
the above actions are available on the VM's desktop
background. Further details can be found via
[Google](https://www.google.com).

When you are done using the VM, please **shut it down gracefully**:
use the top-bar menu icon to select the `Shut Down` or `Log Out`
button, select the `Shut Down` option, and then wait for the VM window
to close automatically once the VM has shut down.

## Transferring Data to/from the VM

The VM behaves as if it's a separate computer form the machine you run
it on. Thus, we must transfer data to or from the VM fairly
regularly. There are a variety of methods for doing this:

- Use [Dropbox](https://db.tt/3QPOD94) to sync all VM data to your local machine
- Use `git` to sync your code/data to a cloud-based site like
  [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Use VirtualBox's [shared-folders](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders)
  feature to move data between the VM and your local machine
- Use email to send your files to yourself
- Use `rsync` or `scp` to copy your files via
  [SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) to the
  [CU CS ELRA Servers](https://csel.cs.colorado.edu).

Of these options, [Dropbox](https://db.tt/3QPOD94) is the simplest to
use. Simply [sign up](https://db.tt/3QPOD94) for a Dropbox account and
then sign into Dropbox via the window that pops up when you boot the
VM. Once singed in, save all your files to the `~/Dropbox` directory
in your home folder and your work will be atomically synced to the
cloud. To sync it to your local machine, simply install Dropbox there
as well and your Dropbox folder will get synced automatically between
the VM and local machine.

As with any computer, it's important to **backup your work**! Users
who's only copy of their data resides on the VM will likelihood not
have pleasant experiences. Thus, please make sure you use one or more
of the above methods to keep a second, off-VM copy of your data at all
times.
