Using the VM is the simplest method to get up and running, but there
are other options available for the adventurous, advanced, or
obstinate. A few such options are discussed here.

Note that these methods are not officially supported by the
department. As such, should you pursue them you'll mostly be on your
own in terms of support. It is your responsibility to make sure your
code also works on the official VM/lab systems even if you choose to
develop it on an unsupported platform.

## Using a Native Linux Install

VMs are great for getting up and running quickly with minimal
hassle. That said, if you're planning on majoring in CS or otherwise
see yourself spending a lot of time working in a Linux-based
environment, you would likely benefit from a native Linux install over
using the VM. This can generally be done either as a replacement for your
current native OS (e.g. OSX or Windows) or as a dual-boot in addition
to your native OS.

For maximum compatibility with the official environment, we recommend
installing a Ubuntu LTS-based Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04,
Xubuntu 16.04, Lubuntu 16.04, etc). If you do this, you can install
the [CU CS APT repos](https://apt.cs.colorado.edu) on your machine and
then install all the software for a given course by running:

`$ sudo apt-get install cu-cs-csci-<course number>`

Instructions for setting up Ubuntu can be found
[online](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop). Dual-boot
direction are also
[readily](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/MacOSX)
[available](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot). If you
require assistance setting up a native Ubuntu-based Linux install, feel free
to contact [help@cs.colorado.edu](mailto:help@cs.colorado.edu).

If you wish to install a non-Ubuntu Linux variant, you'll need to
handle setting up the necessary Software for a given course on your
own. You may be able to translate the Ubuntu packages names into your
native package manager's names by consulting the [CU CS APT Source
Code](https://github.com/ethanhanner/cu-cs-apt-packages). We know of CS
students successfully using [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/),
[Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/),
[openSuse](https://www.opensuse.org/en/),
[Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), and a variety of other non-Ubuntu
Linux flavors.

## Using Your Native OS

While Linux is great for a wide range of CS (and any other) work, you
may be able to get away with working directly in your native OS. To do
so, you'll likely need to install a text editor
(e.g. [vim](http://www.vim.org/),
[emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/),
[sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/), etc) or IDE
(e.g. [eclipse](https://eclipse.org/),
[netbeans](https://netbeans.org/),
[VisualStudio](http://www.visualstudio.com/), etc), as well as the
language(s) you plan to work in (e.g. python, C++, C, etc). The process
for doing this varies by system: try Google-ing or consulting those
who have come before you.
