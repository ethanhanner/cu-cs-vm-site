# CU CS Virtual Machine

### Fall 2017 Edition

The CU CS VM is the simplest way to get a local copy of the CU
[Standardized Development
Environment](https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/sde/).  It provides a
free, local Linux-based development system similar to what we run in
[our labs](https://csel.cs.colorado.edu).

Here you can find information on [obtaining](#obtain),
[installing](#install), [using](#usage), and [troubleshooting](#faq)
the [CU](http://www.colorado.edu/) [CS](http://www.colorado.edu/cs/) [Virtual
Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).
