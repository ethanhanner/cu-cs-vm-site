# CU CS Virtual Machine

### Summer 2018 Edition

The CU CS VM provides a free, local Linux-based development system
similar to what we run in
[our labs](https://csel.cs.colorado.edu). It is primarily used in CS
undergraduate courses to ensure all students, teachers, and TAs are
using the same standardized environment.

Here you can find information on [obtaining](#obtain),
[installing](#install), [using](#usage), and [troubleshooting](#faq)
the CU CS Virtual Machine.

If you would like to setup the VM yourself, [scroll down](#obtain) or
use the navigation links above to continue.

**IMPORTANT CHANGES AS OF SUMMER 2018 --- READ THIS**

- the VM will **NOT** be distributed through flash drives or during recitations any more. To obtain the VM, you will need to use one of the links [below](#obtain) to download your own copy.
