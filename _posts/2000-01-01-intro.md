# CU CS Virtual Machine

### Spring 2018 Edition

The CU CS VM provides a free, local Linux-based development system
similar to what we run in
[our labs](https://csel.cs.colorado.edu). It is primarily used in CS
undergraduate courses to ensure all students, teachers, and TAs are
using the same standardized environment.

Here you can find information on [obtaining](#obtain),
[installing](#install), [using](#usage), and [troubleshooting](#faq)
the [CU](http://www.colorado.edu/) [CS](http://www.colorado.edu/cs/) [Virtual
Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).
