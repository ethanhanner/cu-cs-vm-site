## Methods

The CU CS VM download is available in two versions:
[BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) and
[HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)

_We recommend using the BitTorrent download; it is faster and less prone
to errors than the HTTP method. To use BitTorrent, you'll need to first
install a **BitTorrent Client**. If you do not already have a BitTorrent
client installed, we recommend 
[qTorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) for OSX or Windows,
and [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) for Linux._

## Downloads

The VM can be downloaded via the links below:

- **XFCE x64** (Default):
  [Torrent](https://csel-archive.cs.colorado.edu/vm-images/cu-cs-vm-spring18-xfce-x64-v1.0.torrent)
  or
  [HTTP](https://csel-archive.cs.colorado.edu/vm-images/cu-cs-vm-spring18-xfce-x64-v1.0.zip)

If you are experiencing difficulty either downloading or installing the VM, 
please email Ethan Hanner at [help@cs.colorado.edu](mailto:help@cs.colorado.edu)
or come by ECOT 627 during office hours (see times [above](#intro)).
