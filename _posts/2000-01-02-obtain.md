## Flavors

Each semester VM comes in one or more flavors to accommodate various
systems and use cases. This semester, the following flavors are
supported:

- **XFCE x64** (Default): Most user should use this version.

## Methods

The CU CS VM can be obtained via three methods:

- Download using [BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)
- Download using [HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
- Copy from a USB Flash Drive

_If you're going to download the VM, we recommend using the BitTorrent
method: it is faster and less prone to errors than the HTTP method. To
use BitTorrent, you'll need to first install a **BitTorrent Client**. If
you do not already have a BitTorrent client installed, we recommend
[qTorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) for OSX or
Windows, and [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) for
Linux._

To obtain a copy of the VM from a **USB Flash Drive**, please attend
one of the [help sessions](#intro).
